MANUAL START
==============================================================================

To manually start SIRIUS call: java IPL -Xmx1G
- This will grant up to 1 GB of heap (change -Xmx setting according to needs)
- Add -Dconsole=true to enable log output to the console
- Add -Ddebug=true to enable development settings
 (more logs, shorter cache ttls, etc.)

UNIX / LINUX
==============================================================================

This application is using the SIRIUS framework. Use the sirius.sh script to
start or stop the application. Create a file named config.sh to override
the startup variables.

The config.sh should probably consist of:
export SERVICE=<name>
export JAVA_JMX=1g

Then use ./sirius.sh install to install as a service and utility.
The service can then be managed by calling service <name> start|stop|restart
or by using the utility <name> logs|show|install|uninstall|patch

To use authbind (to access ports < 1024) do the following:
cd /etc/authbind/byport
touch 80
chown USER:USER
chmod 700 80

WINDOWS
==============================================================================

Use APACHES prunmgr to install SIRIUS as a service:
https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-daemon/procrun.html

Install service as "TestService" using 9191 as shutdown port and 1GB heap:
prunsrv-x64 //IS//TestService --DisplayName="Test Service" --Install=c:\install_path\prunsrv-x64.exe --Jvm=auto --StartMode=jvm --StopMode=jvm --StartClass=IPL --StartParams=start;9191 --StopClass=IPL --StopParams=stop;9191 --JvmMx=1g

Use: prunmgr //ES/TestService to edit further settings (especially the stop timeout and memory settings)

CONFIGURATION
==============================================================================

The application can be further configured by creating a file named instance.conf
in the base directory (where this file is). Have a look at the main config
in app/application.conf or the module config (app/component-*.conf) but
never modify those, as all changes will be reverted by the next release. Use
the instance.conf to override or extend the configuration. This file has
precedence over all others.
